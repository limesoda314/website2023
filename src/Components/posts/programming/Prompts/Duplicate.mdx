## Contains Duplicate
[Question List](Coding-Questions)

### [Prompt 1](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/description/)
> Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```


#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```


#### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```


Constraints
```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
```



### [Prompt 2]((https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-ii/description/))
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] == nums[j] and abs(i - j) <= k.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: true
```


#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
Output: true
```


#### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: false
```

 

Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
0 <= k <= 10^5
```



# Solutions 

### Prompt 1
Given an array of integers, return true if any value appears more than once
Return false if every value is distinct


Solution 1:  (did not actually code it)
* Sort the array 
* go through every item and compare if it's the same as the last 
* if any of the comparisons are equal, then there is a duplicate 
* runtime: O(nlogn) + O(n) -> O(nlogn)
* cons: must sort the array, will need to find a better solution 

Solution 2: 
* create a hash map of every value and true or false if any value occurs more than once
* runtime: O(n)


### Prompt 2 
My attempt:

In this problem we want to figure out if there are any duplicates k indices apart in the array. 
I use a map to keep track of at max k indices from the vector nums. At each iteration through nums, we check if the value exists in the map of k indices and if it does, we can return true. When we insert when the map is at the size of k, we remove the first item in the map since it will be too far away.
