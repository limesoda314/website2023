```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

Example 2:
![Alt text](/images/programming/middle-linked-2.png)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```
 

Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100
```
