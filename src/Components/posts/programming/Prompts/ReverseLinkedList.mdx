# Reverse Linked List

[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/) â€¢ [Question List](Coding-Questions)
> Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

 
Example 1:
![Alt text](/images/programming/reverse-linked-1.png)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

Example 2:
![Alt text](/images/programming/reverse-linked-2.png)
```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```

Example 3:
```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
 

Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
