## Linear Recurrence Solution 

For this problem, we can solve for the particular solution which would leave us with a formula that we can just plug n into. 

The steps we need to take in order to get the particular solution is listed below:

1) find the recurrence formula
2) solve for characteristic equation 
3) solve for roots
4) find general solutin
5) solve for initial conditions
6) plug in initial conditions into general solution 


### Find the Recurrence Formula 
To find the recurrence formula, we must first identify the base cases and the recursive step. 

In this problem, we know that if n=1, then there is only 1 distinct way, if n=2 there are 2 distinct ways, if n=3 there are 3 distinct ways, if n=4 there are 5 distinct ways and so forth.  

After n=2, we can use what we know from the previous steps in order to solve for the number of distinct ways at n.

If we were to do this in code, a basic solution is:

```c++
int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n == 1) {
        return 1; 
    }
    if (n == 2) {
        return 2;
    }
    return climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2); 
}
```

The first two if statements are the base cases and the bottom return statement is our recursive step. 

If were were to write out the recurrence formula, we are left with the following

Recurrence Formula: 

$$t_n = t_{n-1} + t_{n-2}$$ for n>2 

$$t_1 = 1, t_2 = 2$$

We can figure out if it works for different values of n: 

- $$$t_3 = t_2+t_1 = 3$$$
- $$$t_4 = t_3+t_2 = 5$$$
- $$$t_5 = t_4+t_3 = 8$$$ 
- $$$t_6 = ... $$$

Furthermore, when n=0, then t_0=1 since n=0 represents no steps which is one distinct way. 


### Solving for characteristic equation

The next step is to solve for the characteristic equation, this means that we are trying to find the *exact* formula. To do so, we must first convert our recurrence formula in the form of Fn.

$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$

$$F_1 = 1, F_2 = 2$$


Now, we know that Fn grows exponentially, we can assume that Fn = x^n. If we are to sub that in we get the following: 


$$F_n = x^n$$, sub in x^2

$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$

$$x^n = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}$$

divide both sides by $x^{n-2}$ 

$$x^n = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}$$ 
$$x^2 = x + 1$$ 


Now that we are left with our characteristic equation, we can solve for the roots 

Characteristic Equation: $$x^2 - x - 1 = 0$$


### Solve for roots: 
Since our characteristic equation is a polynomial equation, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for the roots. 


    quadratic formula: $$x = (\frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2-4ac})}{2a}; \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2-4ac})}{2a}$$

    $x = \frac{-(-1) + \sqrt{(-1)^2-4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)}; \frac{-(-1) - \sqrt{(-1)^2-4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)}$ 
    
    $x = \frac{ 1 + \sqrt5 }{ 2 }; \frac{1 - \sqrt5 }{2}$




### Finding the General Solution

Now assuming that g(n) satisfies our recurrence: g(n) = g1(n-1) + g2(n-2)

Then for any constant a, a*g(n) must also satisfy the recurrence. That means for all functions $a_1x_1^n$ and $a_2x_2^n$ satisfy our recurrence (where $g_1(n)=x_1^n$ and $g_2(n)=x_2^n$)

If g1(n) and g2(n) are solutions of the recurrence, then so is their sum g(n)
g(n)=g1(n)+g2(n)

If so, we know that the following equation satisfies the recurrence and is our general solution:


$$F_n = a_1x_1^n + a_2x_2^n$$


### Solving for the initial conditions:     

Now that we know what the general solution is, we can now solve for the initial conditions 

We know that when: 

n = 0 
- $$a_1x_1^0 + a_2x_2^0 = 1 \rightarrow a_1 + a_2 = 1$$

n = 1 
- $$a_1x_1^1 + a_2x_2^1 = 1 \rightarrow a_1(\frac{1 + \sqrt5 }{2}) + a_2(\frac{ 1 - \sqrt5 }{2} ) = 1$$

Solve for $a_1$ and $a_2$: 
        
- If $$a_2 = 1 - a_1$$:
    - Sub in $$1-a_1$$: 
        - $$a_1(\frac{ 1 + \sqrt5 }{2}) + (1- a_1)(\frac{1 - \sqrt5 }{2} ) = 1 $$
    - Expand $$(1- a_1)(( 1 - \sqrt5 ) / 2 )$$
        - $$a_1\frac{ 1 + \sqrt5 }{2 } + \frac{ 1 - \sqrt5 }{2 } + a_1(-\frac{ 1 - \sqrt5 }{2 }) = 1 $$
    - Combine like terms ($a_1$): 
        - $$\frac{ 1 - \sqrt5 }{2 }+ a_1 [-\frac{ 1 - \sqrt5 }{2 } + \frac{ 1 + \sqrt5 }{2 } ] = 1$$ 
    - commutative rule ( 1 - sqrt(5) ) / 2:  
        - $$a_1 [ \frac{ -1 + \sqrt5 }{2 } + \frac{1+\sqrt5}{2}] = 1 - \frac{ 1 - \sqrt5 }{2 } $$ 
    - Combine like terms: 
        - $$a_1 [ \frac{-1+\sqrt5}{2} + \frac{ 1 + \sqrt5 }{2 } ] = 2/2- \frac{ 1 - \sqrt5 }{2 } $$     
        - $$a_1\frac{\sqrt5}{2} = \frac{1+\sqrt5}{2}$$
    - divide by $$\frac{2\sqrt5}{2}$$
        - $$a_1 = \frac{\frac{1+\sqrt5}{2}} {\frac{2\sqrt5}{2}}$$
        - $$a_1 = \frac{1+\sqrt5}{2\sqrt5}$$

    $$a_1 = \frac{1+\sqrt5}{2\sqrt5}; a_2 = \frac{-1+\sqrt5}{2\sqrt5}$$

    Solve for Particular Solution 
        - Plug in a_1 and a_2 into General Solution 
            - $$F_n = a_1x_1^n + a_2x_2^n  $$
            - $$F_n = \frac{1+\sqrt5}{2\sqrt5}* (\frac{-1+\sqrt5}{2})^n  + \frac{-1+\sqrt5}{2\sqrt5} * (\frac{1-\sqrt5}{2})^n$$
            - $$F_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt5} ([(\frac{1+\sqrt5}{2})* (\frac{1+\sqrt5}{2})^n] + [-(\frac{1-\sqrt5}{2}) * (\frac{1-\sqrt5}{2})^n]) $$
            - $$Fn = \frac{1}{\sqrt5} [(\frac{1+\sqrt5}{2})^{n+1} - (\frac{1-\sqrt5}{2})^{n+1}]$$

        
        Solution: 
            $$Fn = \frac{1}{\sqrt5} [(\frac{1+\sqrt5}{2})^{n+1} - (\frac{1-\sqrt5}{2})^{n+1}]$$
