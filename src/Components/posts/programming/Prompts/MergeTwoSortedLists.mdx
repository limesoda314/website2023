## Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists 

[Leetcode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/) â€¢ [Question List](Coding-Questions)
>You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

>Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

>Return the head of the merged linked list.

 

Example 1:
![Alt text](/images/programming/merge-two-linked.png)
```
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
```

Example 3:
```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```


Constraints:
```
The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
```
